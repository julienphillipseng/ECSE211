# DPM Final Project - Fall 2018

## Captain Hook

#### Goal

The goal of this project is to design and construct a machine that can autonomously navigate a
closed course in search of a set of colored rings. Once found, the machine must determine how
to grasp and retrieve as many rings as possible, taking into account the value of each ring as
depicted by its color.

#### Description

This software is meant to be used with a Lego Mindstorms EV3 robot. We use the [Lejos API](http://lejos.org/ev3.php).
